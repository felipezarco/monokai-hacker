I've created it so that:
- Covering all possible syntax highlights.
- Clear visibility of keywords.
- Systemic representation of numbers and logical operators (blue).
- Easily identifiable and distinguishable parameters (classic Monokai orange).
- Thicker formatting for double-quoted strings and template strings (similar to Ruby interpolation).
- White is the default color, making it easy to spot when a variable turns into a keyword.
- Maintaining a colorful theme while prioritizing efficiency.

And yeah, green will always be the right colour if you write instructions to machines!

(This theme is not specifically designed to address colorblind issues, but if you are colorblind, this theme will also work well for you.)
