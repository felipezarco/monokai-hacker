### VSCode Theme Monokai Hacker High Contrast Matrix Terminal

I have been using this theme for years. Mostly for Javascript and Typescript.

Download at Visual Studio Marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipezarco.monokai-hacker

I've created it so that:

- Keywords are shown clearly
- Numbers and logical operators seem systemic
- Parameters are easy to spot and track (classic monokai orange)
- Strings are thicker when double-quoted or template (like ruby interpolation)
- White is the default color, hence it is easy to spot whether a variable turned into a keyword or not
- It is colorful but only the necessary to be efficient
- Green is the right colour if you write instructions to machines

If you enjoy it, do not forget to star it ‚≠ê at https://github.com/felipezarco/monokai-hacker
