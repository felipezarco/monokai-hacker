# Monokai Hacker

## VSCode Theme Monokai Hacker High Contrast Matrix Terminal



I have been using this theme for years. For me it is the best available. 

The reason is:

- Keywords are shown clear (green)
- Numbers and logical operators seem systemic (blue)
- Parameters are easy to spot and track (classic monokai orange)
- Strings are thicker when double-quoted or template
